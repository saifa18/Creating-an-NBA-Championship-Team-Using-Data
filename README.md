## Description
This project, completed for my **MKT 360: Information and Analysis** course, analyzes the efficacy of NBA players during the 2023-2024 season based on their salaries. 
My team and I selected this dataset to explore the relationship between player performance and financial value. The project includes a detailed presentation, a Jupyter Notebook with 
data analysis and visualizations, and a comprehensive final report. Dive in to discover our insights and methodology!
